### Basic architecture of RL models:
The entities in RL's world are,

1. The agent Class: A thing, or person, that tries to gain rewards by interaction. In practice, the agent is a piece of code that implements some policy.

2. The environment Class: It's a model of the world that is external to the agent.It provides observations and rewards to agent.
